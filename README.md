# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

 <h1> Introduction </h1>
<h2><i class="uil uil-eye"></i> Project Overview</h2>
<b>
This project is an exciting Movie Rating and Queue App. It provides users with two core functionalities:
<b>
</br>
<p>
1. Movie Ratings: In this app, you can easily rate your favorite movies. Each movie is displayed elegantly, allowing you to give it a star rating from 0 to 5. This helps you keep track of the movies you love and discover new ones based on community ratings.
</p>
<p>
2. Queue Management: The app includes a "Queue" feature that allows you to create a personalized list of movies you want to watch in the future. Just click the "Add to Queue" button on any movie card to build your collection of must-watch films.
</p>

<h2><i class="uil uil-file-medical-alt"></i> Features </h2>

<h3><i class="uil uil-react"></i> Getting Started with npm create vite@latest my-project -- --template react </h3>

<h2> Available Scripts </h2>
In the project directory, you can run:

<h4> npm run dev</h4>
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:5173 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

<h4> npm test </h4>
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

<h4> npm run build </h4>
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

<h4> npm run eject </h4>
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
